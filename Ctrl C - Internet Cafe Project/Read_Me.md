##### Requirements to set up our system

* Make sure your java version is 18 or above and support javafx.
* our system include of two projects to work properly so be careful to import both **admin** and **client.**
* you will need **Apache Netbean** software to import our projects. I don't know if this project can run on **Eclipse** but it's best you use **Netbean.**
* you will also need to import database. we provided our database file which is "**cafe.sql**"
* If u also want to view the details inside of the project you might as well need **SceneBuilder** Software to view FXML files.
* After import u have to import all the library files into the project.(I provided the Library Folder for both projects just import them all)



##### How to Run Our System?

* Our original Purpose is client Server System, So if you want the best out of it, you will need two laptops. One for server and one for client. If you don't have two laptops, it's okay since you can run on one laptop as **Localhost**.
* if u run on two laptops, for client server to work, both laptop have to be on the same wifi. This doesn't count for **localhost.**
* in the client app. there's adminstration button. In there u can change the ip address and pcno as u want. The ip address must be the server laptop's ip.(press **Win+R**, type **cmd** and type **ipconfig** on server laptop to get server ip) For **localhost**(single laptop) just type "localhost" in the ip field. Then save it close the program and run again.
* For the database, localhost guys must change the path in dbconnection to localhost. For two laptops RK guys, you must change the server ip address in the path.
* That's all! If you wanna know the system is working or not, just check the console terminncal in netbean. We add a lot of debugging for that.
